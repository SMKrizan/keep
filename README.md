# "keep" budget tracker

User Story
AS AN avid traveler
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated


The Food Festival application that you created in this module's lessons did not include an Express.js server, so you used the webpack-dev-server npm module to test the service worker with an HTTPS-enabled server.

For this Challenge, however, you aren't using webpack, but you do have an Express.js server provided to you in the starter code. Remember that Chrome DevTools makes it possible to test service workers on localhost in development. Simply click the Application tab, then select Service Workers from the menu on the left.


Once you’ve updated the existing budget tracker, it should provide the following functionality:

The ability to enter deposits offline.

The ability to enter expenses offline.

Offline entries should be added to the tracker when the application is brought back online.

review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 5: Convert the App to a PWA as a refresher on web manifests.

Deployment to Heroku Using MongoDB Atlas
Finally, the budget tracker has a server and uses MongoDB as its database, so you’ll need to deploy this application to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas. To review this process, look at Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 5: Add Mongoose Validation, specifically 18.5.5: Deploy to Heroku.
